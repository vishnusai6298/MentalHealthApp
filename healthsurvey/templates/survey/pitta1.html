                        Pitta types are intelligent, perceptive and discriminating. They have sharp minds and are able
                        to see the
                        world in a clear and systematic manner. However, they can also be opinionated, judgmental and
                        self
                        -righteous.
                        They are prone to anger and tend to be aggressive and domineering. They are not afraid of
                        conflict and can
                        be more aggressive when the situation presents itself. They have probing minds and can be good
                        at research.
                        They also have good debating skills.
                        They have a hard time seeing someone elseâ€™s point of view and may lack compassion. They prefer
                        hierarchy and
                        authority over consensus. They are highly determined people.
                        They usually have food self-control but they can be self-absorbed and anti-social.
                        High pitta causes aggressiveness and violence.

                    <h4> Asanas: </h4>

                    <p>
                        Pittas should perform asanas in a way that is cooling, nurturing, expansive and relaxing. This
                        requires
                        relaxing breaths and quiet sitting between strong asanas to release any developing stress. They
                        should be
                        careful not to turn their practice into a strong workout in which additional heat is generated
                        in the body
                        or in which too much sweating occurs.

                        Putting the body regularly into the shoulder stand or plow pose protects the lunar principle
                        from the
                        depleting heat of the solar principle and creates coolness. Such postures help reverse the
                        positions of the
                        sun and the moon in the body, bringing balance. This is naturally beneficial for pittas. Spinal
                        twists, like
                        Matyendrasana, are also very good for protecting the lunar principle without reducing agni or
                        the power of
                        digestion.

                        Pitta people are benefited by postures that aim at releaSing tension from the mid-abdomen, the
                        small
                        intestine and liver, where pitta accumulates. Such are the bow pose, cobra pose, boat pose, and
                        fish pose.
                        Forward bends are generally good for pitta because they bring more energy to the mid-abdomen and
                        have a
                        cooling and grounding effect if done gently. Backbends tend to be heating and so should be done
                        only with
                        moderation and followed by cooling postures. Seated twists help clear the liver, detoxifying
                        pitta.
