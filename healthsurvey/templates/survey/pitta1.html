                        <p>
                            Pitta types are intelligent, perceptive and discriminating. They have sharp minds and are
                            able to see the
                            world in a clear and systematic manner. However, they can also be opinionated, judgmental
                            and self
                            -righteous.
                            They are prone to anger and tend to be aggressive and domineering. They are not afraid of
                            conflict and can
                            be more aggressive when the situation presents itself. They have probing minds and can be
                            good at
                            research.
                            They also have good debating skills.
                            They have a hard time seeing someone elseâ€™s point of view and may lack compassion. They
                            prefer hierarchy
                            and
                            authority over consensus. They are highly determined people.
                            They usually have food self-control but they can be self-absorbed and anti-social.
                            High pitta causes aggressiveness and violence.

                        <h4> Asanas: </h4>


                        <p>
                            Vatas need to perform asanas in a way that reduces vata, starting with the right mental
                            attitude. Asana
                            practice for vata types should emphasize the pelvic region and colon, the main sites of
                            vata. They should
                            aim at releasing tension from the hips, lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints. In general,
                            their asanas
                            should
                            restrict movement to counter vata's tendency to excess activity.

                            Sitting postures are good for vata, particularly those that create strength and stillness in
                            the lower
                            abdomen, like siddhasana (lotus pose) and vajrasana. Since vata tends to accumulate in the
                            spine, making
                            it
                            stiff, vatas should focus on keeping the spinal column supple by practicing spinal bending
                            in every
                            direction. Spinal twists like matsyedrasana are excellent, removing vata from the nervous
                            system.

                            Forward bends afford immediate relief for excess vata, producing calm and stillness.
                            Backbends are
                            excellent
                            for reducing vata but must be done gently and slowly to be effective. Small backward bends,
                            like cobra and
                            locust, are the safest in this regard. Standing postures that emphasize strength, stability
                            and calm are
                            very good for vata, particularly those that aim at developing stillness and balance like the
                            tree pose
                            (vrksasana).
