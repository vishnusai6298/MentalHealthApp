            Kaphas are naturally emotional in temperament and have tremendous love, devotion and loyalty. Negatively,
            they can have great desire, and may be possessive and greedy. They are romantic, sentimental, and cry
            easily.
            They are slower in learning than others but they retain what they learn well. They are better at finishing
            things than they are at starting something new. They are natural followers and like to work in association
            or within large teams.
            They are stable but can sometimes stagnate. They donâ€™t like change and find it very difficult to change even
            when they want to. They are friendly to people they know but have difficulty in relating to foreigners.
            Kapha types are least likely to express anti-social behavior but they are preoccupied with what others think
            about them.
            High kaha cuses metal dullness and poor perception and they tend to suffer from a lack of motivation.
            They tend to want to own and control everything and have a high degree of possessiveness
            They are prone to over-sleeping overindulging.
